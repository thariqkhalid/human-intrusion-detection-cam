# human-intrusion-detection-cam

The aim of the project is to detect human intruders into a private compound. The intruders fall under the categories of burglars,
gunmen, suspicious persons, etc. We also need to recognize any abnormal activity among the people in the scene.

Once the detection or the recognition happens, an alarm is raised to the authorities.

Deep Learning technology with Computer Vision will be used to solve the above mentioned problems.
